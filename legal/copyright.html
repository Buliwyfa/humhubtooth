					<h2>Re-using Wikia Content and Software</h2>
					<p>Wikia Search is dedicated to furthering the free software and copyleft movements.   Only through the transparency demanded and the community input furthered by these tenets can a search project ever reach the pinnacle of quality demanded by the ever-expanding Internet user base.</p>
					<p>With these requirements in mind, all of Wikia Searchs software, as well as the Wikia Search index, are available for your re-use.</p>
					<p>The software which powers is licensed under the <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD license</A>, which allows for re-use and re-distribution of the source code so long as due attribution is given to Wikia Search and the secondary use is also licensed under the BSD license.  (The full terms of the license are in the LICENSE.txt file in each software package below.)<p>
					<p>The search index, including user-initiated edits and the crawled data in raw form, are available under the <A HREF="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0 Unported  license</A> (CC-BY-SA 3.0 Unported).    This license allows you to re-use and re-distribute the data so long as due attribution is given to Wikia Search and, if you make derivative works from this data, you in turn license your work under the same or compatible license.

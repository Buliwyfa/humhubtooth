					<p>Keeping your privacy in high regard is a fundamental principal of Wikia Search.   We believe that a searcher's privacy must be protected and respected, on both a technological and social level.</p>
					<p>This policy outlines the information Wikia collects, how we use that information, and how you can control how your information is shared.  This policy applies only to Wikia Search and services that are owned and operated by Wikia, Inc ("the Company").   Please be aware that when you follow a link to another site, this privacy policy does not apply, and Wikia has no control over what information they collect from you.  Please further note that in the event that this policy conflicts with our <a href="legal.html">terms of use</a>, the terms of use controls.</p></p>

					<p>This policy may change from time to time.  This policy was last updated on May 29, 2008.</p>
					<h2>The Information We Collect, And What We Do With It</h2>
					<h3>In General</h3>
					<p>In order to sign up for a Wikia Search account, we ask that you provide us with your first name, last name, e-mail address, a username, password, your birthday, and your gender.   We use this information to improve your experience with Wikia Search.  Some of this information (e.g. your username, first name, and last name) appear by default on your profile.</p>
					<p>Wikia Search also may send one or more cookies - a small file that lives in your web browser - which helps Wikia Search operate with full functionality (such as keeping you logged into the service).  Most web browsers allow you to disable cookies, and you are welcome to continue to use Wikia Search if you choose to do so.  However, some of Wikia Search's features may not function properly if cookies are disabled.</p>
					<p>Wikia Search's servers also log some information whenever you access the site; information such as your IP address, the time of your visit, your browser type and your browser's language setting.</p>

					<p>If you send a communication to the Company, we may hold onto that communication so that we can respond appropriately, and so that we can incorporate your feedback to improve Wikia Search.</p>
					<h3>Search</h3>
					<p>You are not required to register for an account or to provide any personal information to us in order to use the search engine at Wikia Search.   However, Wikia Search collects changes to search results pages and other search-related information.</p>
					<p>Wikia Search collects all the information you provide when you modify the search results (such as making edits, deleting items, spotlighting a result, adding comments, leaving a star rating, annotating a result, etc), the related searches area, or the header of a search results page.   An indicator that you provided that information is left on the search results page's history; on Global Changes, and on your profile.</p>
					<h3>Social Tools</h3>

					<p>When you register with Wikia Search, you automatically create a social profile. The intent of the social tools is to facilitate in sharing this profile information, and other information you may add over time, with others.</p>
					<p>Your profile information, as well as any other information you add to your profile as you use Wikia Search (e.g. work history, interests), is displayed by Wikia Search to others as determined by your Privacy Setting.   We also occasionally use this information to send you an e-mail alert regarding information you may find useful.</p>
					<p>When using Wikia Search's social tools, you may send messages, create relationships, and transmit information through other similar channels. We collect and retain this information to provide a quality social environment and so that in many cases, you can return to Wikia Search to see that information (e.g. we retain information about your Wikia Search relationships so that you can see your friends list).  We typically back up this information in order to protect your data in case of machine error.</p>
					<h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
					<p>Wikia Search only shares your information with others in the following circumstances:</p>

					<ol>
					   <li>As described above</li>
					   <li>With our subsidiaries and affiliated companies, contractors, and vendors.  We require these parties to process your information in compliance with this policy.</li>
					   <li>As required by law enforcement agencies</li>
					   <li>Internal investigation of breach of security?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>If the Company becomes involved in a merger or acquisition or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice to you, via an update to this policy, of any personal information to be transferred and/or subject to a different policy.</p>

					<p>We may also share with third parties aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of new user registrations over a specific time period or the number of users who search for a particular term.</p>
